### Hi there I'm Shivank ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: xtremedev786@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

In my free time, I like to spend time with my dog Bozzo, playing fetch and going for walks. I also enjoy cooking, with a particular interest in making chole bhature from scratch.

If you have any projects that you think I would be interested in working on, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. especially ML or Web3 stuff.
